Join us to shape the next frontier of AI-driven robotics.\nLearn more at dyna.co\nPosition Overview\nWe are hiring our first-ever marketer.\nThis is not a traditional marketing role. You will not be managing an agency to run ads. You will be the strategic partner to the founders and the \"Chief Narrator\" of Dyna. You will work side-by-side with our leadership team to build the entire marketing engine from scratch—from crafting the pitch that lands a Fortune 500 partnership to attracting the world’s top talents to defining the company branding.\nWe are looking for a \"full-stack\" marketer who is technical enough to understand our foundation models and commercial enough to close deals. You will translate the complexity of embodied AGI into a clear, inevitable truth for our customers, partners, and talents.\nIn This Role, You Will\n• Own the Narrative: You will take our technical breakthroughs and distill them into a compelling story. You will write the words that define who we are—on the website, in events, and in the press.\n• Drive Commercial GTM: Dyna is driven to make real value. You will partner with our founders and deployment teams to build the marketing materials that win customers. This includes creating high-leverage sales collateral and case studies that resonate with customers across industries.\n• Launch Products: You will own the \"moment.\" When we release a new model capability or a new robot form factor, you will orchestrate the launch, coordinating PR, social, video, and developer comms to maximize impact.\n• Win the talents: You will work with our Chief Scientist to understand the top talents we want to achieve and with the partnership team to figure creative ways to discovery and attract the best and the most potential talents in the field.\n• Build the Growth Engine: You will experiment with and define our early channels for lead generation. Whether it’s organizing an exclusive demo day for industry execs or building a content engine that attracts top roboticists, you will find what works and scale it.\nYou Might Thrive In This Role If You\n• Have 3-6+ years of experience in high-growth product marketing or growth marketing, ideally at a deep tech, autonomous driving, or AI application company.\n• If you are just AMAZING, ignore the first point - but tell us why you are special.\n• Are a world-class writer. You don't just write \"copy\"; you write arguments. You can explain why a transformer-based policy is better than classical control theory without using jargon that alienates business buyers.\n• Are a \"0-to-1\" builder. You have likely been the first or second marketer at a company before. You are comfortable working with no playbook, no existing assets, and high expectations.\n• Are technical-curious. You don't need to be an engineer, but you should be fascinated by AI. You are the kind of person who reads the \"Technical Report\" of a new model release, not just the press release.\n• Have a bias for action. We move at the speed of our robots (which is fast). You are comfortable shipping a landing page on Tuesday and flying to a customer site on Thursday to film a testimonial.\nBonus Points\n• Design experience; unique insights in building a brand\n• Experience managing PR or external communications during high-stakes launches.\nWhy Join Now?\nThere are very few times in history when a new category of technology emerges. Personal computing in the 80s, the Internet in the 90s, Generative AI in the 2020s. Embodied AI is next. This is your chance to own the story of the company that brings it to the real world.\nCompensation Range: $170K - $220K",
