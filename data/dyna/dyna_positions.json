You will write the words that define who we are—on the website, in events, and in the press.\n• Drive Commercial GTM: Dyna is driven to make real value.

You don't just write \"copy\"; you write arguments. You can explain why a transformer-based policy is better than classical control theory without using jargon that alienates business buyers.\n• Are a \"0-to-1\" builder. You have likely been the first or second marketer at a company before. You are comfortable working with no playbook, no existing assets, and high expectations.\n• Are technical-curious. You don't need to be an engineer, but you should be fascinated by AI. You are the kind of person who reads the \"Technical Report\" of a new model release, not just the press release.\n• Have a bias for action. We move at the speed of our robots (which is fast). You are comfortable shipping a landing page on Tuesday and flying to a customer site on Thursday to film a testimonial.\nBonus Points\n• Design experience; unique insights in building a brand\n• Experience managing PR or external communications during high-stakes launches.\nWhy Join Now?\nThere are very few times in history when a new category of technology emerges. Personal computing in the 80s, the Internet in the 90s, Generative AI in the 2020s. Embodied AI is next.

If it’s heavy, unintuitive, or feels like a burden, workers won't use it and the AI fails. Your job is to make robot training feel like a power tool workers fight over. You will own the \"UX Concept Lock\" for our next-gen wearable and robotics hardware.\nKey Responsibilities:\n• Hybrid Prototype Architecture: Build the \"connective tissue\" between AI logic and human touch. You will design the digital hooks and program interactions in code while simultaneously hacking together the physical hardware (foam, 3D prints, sensors) that houses them.\n• End-to-End Interaction Loops: Move beyond static screens. You will design unified feedback loops where a digital command triggers a haptic pulse, and a physical gesture updates a cloud-based model. You own the flow from the UI logic to the motor controller.\n• Rapid High-Low Prototyping: Switch fluidly between \"pixel-perfect\" wireframing in Figma and \"dirty\" fabrication in the shop. You’ll be taping sensors to workers in the field and then immediately jumping into code to refine how that data feeds back into the robot’s training model.\n• Field-to-Logic Loop: Spend time in the \"dirt, sweat, and chaos\" of customer facilities. Observe worker body language to identify where the software feels heavy or the hardware feels clumsy, then iterate on both the ergonomics and the interface logic to solve it.\n• Production Stewardship: Partner with JDM (Joint Design Manufacturing) to ensure the \"soul\" of the interaction survives mass production. You will define the technical specs for both physical comfort (weight/balance) and digital performance (latency/feedback triggers).\nQualifications:\n• Experienced Experimenter: 5+ years in high-velocity startups. Crucially: You have worked on at least one hardware device that has shipped and sold.\n• Technically Polyglot: Confident coding for both the hardware (C++/Arduino) and the interface (Python, JavaScript, or similar) to ensure your \"hacked\" prototypes actually function.\n• Physically Fluent: You are a builder. You are confident with 3D printing, basic electronics (Arduino/ESP32), and rapid fabrication.\n• HCI Fundamentalist: Deep understanding of cognitive load and human factors. You have strong opinions on why products fail in the body, not just on paper.\n• Low-Ego, High-Velocity: You get energized by ambiguity and are happy to scrap a week of work if a user \"hates it.\"\nPreferred Qualifications:\n• Systems Thinkers: Backgrounds from CMU MHCI, RISD, or similar (or the self-taught equivalent).\n• Harsh Environments: Experience designing for dirt, sweat, and chaos (Robotics, Wearables, or Tools).\n• Unusual Past Lives: Machinist, dancer, climber, or tinkerer. We value \"weird\" prototypes over polished portfolios.",
